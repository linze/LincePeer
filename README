1 Introduction

LincePeer is a simple P2P application realized as a university 
subject practice.

This application works using the protocol proposed in three 
documents that contains the stages that the students should reach 
to complete the application. The documents are in spanish 
language and can be viewed at [URL]. Documents contained in the 
directories "Practica-3", "Practica-4" and "Practica-5". Examine 
the headers files (.ads) containing the word "protocol" may be 
greatly useful because they have records with the sent or 
received information.
